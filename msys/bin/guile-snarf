# Commentary:

# Usage: guile-snarf [-o OUTFILE] [CPP-ARGS ...]
 
# Initialization actions are extracted to OUTFILE or to standard
# output when no OUTFILE has been specified or when OUTFILE is "-".
# The C preprocessor is called with CPP-ARGS (which usually include a
# input file) and the output is filtered for the actions.
# 
# If there are errors during processing, OUTFILE is deleted and the
# program exits with non-zero status.
# 
# During snarfing, the pre-processor macro SCM_MAGIC_SNARFER is
# defined.  You can use this to avoid including snarfer output files
# that don't yet exist by writing code like this:
# 
#   #ifndef SCM_MAGIC_SNARFER
#   #include "foo.x"
#   #endif
# 
# If the environment variable CPP is set, use its value instead of the
# C pre-processor determined at Guile configure-time: "gcc -E".

# Code:
