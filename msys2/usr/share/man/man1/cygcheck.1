                       with another command, otherwise print this help
  \-V, \-\-version        print the version of cygcheck and exit

Note: \-c, \-f, and \-l only report on packages that are currently installed\&. To
  search all official Cygwin packages use \-p instead\&.  The \-p REGEXP matches
  package names, descriptions, and names of files/paths within all packages\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBcygcheck\fR
program is a diagnostic utility for dealing with Cygwin programs\&. If you are familiar with
\fBdpkg\fR
or
\fBrpm\fR,
\fBcygcheck\fR
is similar in many ways\&. (The major difference is that
\fBsetup\&.exe\fR
handles installing and uninstalling packages; see
the section called \(lqInternet Setup\(rq
for more information\&.)
.PP
The
\-c
option checks the version and status of installed Cygwin packages\&. If you specify one or more package names,
\fBcygcheck\fR
will limit its output to those packages, or with no arguments it lists all packages\&. A package will be marked
Incomplete
if files originally installed are no longer present\&. The best thing to do in that situation is reinstall the package with
\fBsetup\&.exe\fR\&. To see which files are missing, use the
\-v
option\&. If you do not need to know the status of each package and want
\fBcygcheck\fR
to run faster, add the
\-d
option and
\fBcygcheck\fR
will only output the name and version for each package\&.
.PP
If you list one or more programs on the command line,
\fBcygcheck\fR
will diagnose the runtime environment of that program or programs, providing the names of DLL files on which the program depends\&. If you specify the
\-s
option,
\fBcygcheck\fR
will give general system information\&. If you list one or more programs on the command line and specify
\-s,
\fBcygcheck\fR
will report on both\&.
.PP
The
\-f
option helps you to track down which package a file came from, and
\-l
lists all files in a package\&. For example, to find out about
/usr/bin/less
and its package:
.PP
\fBExample\ \&3.3.\ \&Example cygcheck usage\fR
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ cygcheck \-f /usr/bin/less
less\-381\-1

$ cygcheck \-l less
/usr/bin/less\&.exe
/usr/bin/lessecho\&.exe
/usr/bin/lesskey\&.exe
/usr/man/man1/less\&.1
/usr/man/man1/lesskey\&.1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\-h
option prints additional helpful messages in the report, at the beginning of each section\&. It also adds table column headings\&. While this is useful information, it also adds some to the size of the report, so if you want a compact report or if you know what everything is already, just leave this out\&.
.PP
The
\-v
option causes the output to be more verbose\&. What this means is that additional information will be reported which is usually not interesting, such as the internal version numbers of DLLs, additional information about recursive DLL usage, and if a file in one directory in the PATH also occurs in other directories on the PATH\&.
.PP
The
\-r
option causes
\fBcygcheck\fR
to search your registry for information that is relevant to Cygwin programs\&. These registry entries are the ones that have "Cygwin" in the name\&. If you are paranoid about privacy, you may remove information from this report, but please keep in mind that doing so makes it harder to diagnose your problems\&.
.PP
In contrast to the other options that search the packages that are installed on your local system, the
\-p
option can be used to search the entire official Cygwin package repository\&. It takes as argument a Perl\-compatible regular expression which is used to match package names, package descriptions, and path/filenames of the contents of packages\&. This feature requires an active internet connection, since it must query the
cygwin\&.com
web site\&. In fact, it is equivalent to the search that is available on the
\m[blue]\fBCygwin package listing\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
page\&.
.PP
For example, perhaps you are getting an error because you are missing a certain DLL and you want to know which package includes that file:
.PP
\fBExample\ \&3.4.\ \&Searching all packages for a file\fR
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that this option takes a regular expression, not a glob or wildcard\&. This means that you need to use
\&.*
if you want something similar to the wildcard
*
commonly used in filename globbing\&. Similarly, to match the period character you should use
\e\&.
since the
\&.
character in a regexp is a metacharacter that will match any character\&. Also be aware that the characters such as
\e
and
*
are shell metacharacters, so they must be either escaped or quoted, as in the example above\&.
.PP
The third example above illustrates that if you want to match a whole filename, you should include the
/
path seperator\&. In the given example this ensures that filenames that happen to end in
ls\&.exe
such as
ncftpls\&.exe
are not shown\&. Note that this use does not mean "look for packages with
ls
in the root directory," since the
/
can match anywhere in the path\&. It\*(Aqs just there to anchor the match so that it matches a full filename\&.
.PP
By default the matching is case\-sensitive\&. To get a case insensitive match, begin your regexp with
(?i)
which is a PCRE\-specific feature\&. For complete documentation on Perl\-compatible regular expression syntax and options, read the
\fBperlre\fR
manpage, or one of many websites such as
perldoc\&.com
that document the Perl language\&.
.PP
The
\fBcygcheck\fR
program should be used to send information about your system for troubleshooting when requested\&. When asked to run this command save the output so that you can email it, for example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBcygcheck \-s \-v \-r \-h > cygcheck_output\&.txt\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Each Cygwin DLL stores its path and installation key in the registry\&. This allows troubleshooting of problems which could be a result of having multiple concurrent Cygwin installations\&. However, if you\*(Aqre experimenting a lot with different Cygwin installation paths, your registry could accumulate a lot of old Cygwin installation entries for which the installation doesn\*(Aqt exist anymore\&. To get rid of these orphaned registry entries, use the
\fBcygcheck \-\-delete\-orphaned\-installation\-keys\fR
command\&.
