At least one command option or a PROGRAM is required, as shown above.

  PROGRAM              list library (DLL) dependencies of PROGRAM
  -c, --check-setup    show installed version of PACKAGE and verify integrity
                       (or for all installed packages if none specified)
  -d, --dump-only      just list packages, do not verify (with -c)
  -s, --sysinfo        produce diagnostic system information (implies -c -d)
  -r, --registry       also scan registry for Cygwin settings (with -s)
  -k, --keycheck       perform a keyboard check session (must be run from a
                       plain console only, not from a pty/rxvt/xterm)
  -f, --find-package   find the package to which FILE belongs
  -l, --list-package   list contents of PACKAGE (or all packages if none given)
  -p, --package-query  search for REGEXP in the entire cygwin.com package
                       repository (requires internet connectivity)
  --delete-orphaned-installation-keys
                       Delete installation keys of old, now unused
                       installations from the registry.  Requires the right
                       to change the registry.
  -v, --verbose        produce more verbose output
  -h, --help           annotate output with explanatory comments when given
                       with another command, otherwise print this help
  -V, --version        print the version of cygcheck and exit

Note: -c, -f, and -l only report on packages that are currently installed. To
  search all official Cygwin packages use -p instead.  The -p REGEXP matches
  package names, descriptions, and names of files/paths within all packages.
</pre></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="cygcheck-desc"></a><h2>Description</h2><p> The <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> program is a diagnostic utility for
      dealing with Cygwin programs. If you are familiar with
      <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>rpm</strong></span>,
      <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> is similar in many ways. (The major
      difference is that <span class="command"><strong>setup.exe</strong></span> handles installing and
      uninstalling packages; see <a class="xref" href="setup-net.html#internet-setup" title="Internet Setup">the section called &#8220;Internet Setup&#8221;</a> for more
      information.) </p><p> The <code class="literal">-c</code> option checks the version and status of
      installed Cygwin packages. If you specify one or more package names,
      <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> will limit its output to those packages, or
      with no arguments it lists all packages. A package will be marked
      <code class="literal">Incomplete</code> if files originally installed are no longer
      present. The best thing to do in that situation is reinstall the package
      with <span class="command"><strong>setup.exe</strong></span>. To see which files are missing, use
      the <code class="literal">-v</code> option. If you do not need to know the status
      of each package and want <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> to run faster, add
      the <code class="literal">-d</code> option and <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> will
      only output the name and version for each package. </p><p> If you list one or more programs on the command line,
      <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> will diagnose the runtime environment of that
      program or programs, providing the names of DLL files on which the
      program depends. If you specify the <code class="literal">-s</code> option,
      <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> will give general system information. If you
      list one or more programs on the command line and specify
      <code class="literal">-s</code>, <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> will report on
      both.</p><p> The <code class="literal">-f</code> option helps you to track down which
      package a file came from, and <code class="literal">-l</code> lists all files in a
      package. For example, to find out about
      <code class="filename">/usr/bin/less</code> and its package:
    </p><div class="example"><a name="utils-cygcheck-ex"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&#160;3.3.&#160;Example <span class="command">cygcheck</span>
      usage</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">
$ cygcheck -f /usr/bin/less
less-381-1

$ cygcheck -l less
/usr/bin/less.exe
/usr/bin/lessecho.exe
/usr/bin/lesskey.exe
/usr/man/man1/less.1
/usr/man/man1/lesskey.1
</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The <code class="literal">-h</code> option prints additional helpful messages
      in the report, at the beginning of each section. It also adds table
      column headings. While this is useful information, it also adds some to
      the size of the report, so if you want a compact report or if you know
      what everything is already, just leave this out.</p><p>The <code class="literal">-v</code> option causes the output to be more
      verbose. What this means is that additional information will be reported
      which is usually not interesting, such as the internal version numbers of
      DLLs, additional information about recursive DLL usage, and if a file in
      one directory in the PATH also occurs in other directories on the PATH. </p><p>The <code class="literal">-r</code> option causes <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span>
      to search your registry for information that is relevant to Cygwin
      programs. These registry entries are the ones that have "Cygwin" in the
      name. If you are paranoid about privacy, you may remove information from
      this report, but please keep in mind that doing so makes it harder to
      diagnose your problems.</p><p>In contrast to the other options that search the packages that are
      installed on your local system, the <code class="literal">-p</code> option can be
      used to search the entire official Cygwin package repository. It takes as
      argument a Perl-compatible regular expression which is used to match
      package names, package descriptions, and path/filenames of the contents
      of packages. This feature requires an active internet connection, since
      it must query the <code class="literal">cygwin.com</code> web site. In fact, it is
      equivalent to the search that is available on the <a class="ulink" href="https://cygwin.com/packages/" target="_top">Cygwin package listing</a>
      page.</p><p>For example, perhaps you are getting an error because you are missing
      a certain DLL and you want to know which package includes that file:
    </p><div class="example"><a name="utils-search-ex"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&#160;3.4.&#160;Searching all packages for a
      file</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">
$ cygcheck -p 'cygintl-2\.dll'
Found 1 matches for 'cygintl-2\.dll'.

</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>Note that this option takes a regular expression, not a glob or
      wildcard. This means that you need to use <code class="literal">.*</code> if you
      want something similar to the wildcard <code class="literal">*</code> commonly used
      in filename globbing. Similarly, to match the period character you should
      use <code class="literal">\.</code> since the <code class="literal">.</code> character in a
      regexp is a metacharacter that will match any character. Also be aware
      that the characters such as <code class="literal">\</code> and <code class="literal">*</code>
      are shell metacharacters, so they must be either escaped or quoted, as in
      the example above.</p><p>The third example above illustrates that if you want to match a whole
      filename, you should include the <code class="literal">/</code> path seperator. In
      the given example this ensures that filenames that happen to end in
      <code class="literal">ls.exe</code> such as <code class="literal">ncftpls.exe</code> are not
      shown. Note that this use does not mean "look for packages with
      <code class="literal">ls</code> in the root directory," since the
      <code class="literal">/</code> can match anywhere in the path. It's just there to
      anchor the match so that it matches a full filename.</p><p>By default the matching is case-sensitive. To get a case insensitive
      match, begin your regexp with <code class="literal">(?i)</code> which is a
      PCRE-specific feature. For complete documentation on Perl-compatible
      regular expression syntax and options, read the <span class="command"><strong>perlre</strong></span>
      manpage, or one of many websites such as <code class="literal">perldoc.com</code>
      that document the Perl language.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> program should be used to send
      information about your system for troubleshooting when requested. When
      asked to run this command save the output so that you can email it, for
      example:</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">$</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>cygcheck -s -v -r -h &gt; cygcheck_output.txt</code></strong>
</pre><p> Each Cygwin DLL stores its path and installation key in the
      registry. This allows troubleshooting of problems which could be a result
      of having multiple concurrent Cygwin installations. However, if you're
      experimenting a lot with different Cygwin installation paths, your
      registry could accumulate a lot of old Cygwin installation entries for
      which the installation doesn't exist anymore. To get rid of these
      orphaned registry entries, use the <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck
      --delete-orphaned-installation-keys</strong></span> command.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="chattr.html">Prev</a>&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="using-utils.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&#160;<a accesskey="n" href="cygpath.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">chattr&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="cygwin-ug-net.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&#160;cygpath</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
